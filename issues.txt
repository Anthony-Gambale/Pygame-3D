done
 - make WASD move the camera relative to the direction of the normal vector
 - make the arrow keys rotate the image plane about its basis vectors, rather than about the x and y axes

to do
 - make sure that any objects 'behind' the camera aren't drawn to the image plane
 - fix strange "teleportation" effect when rotating camera. solution to this is probably to ditch use of cross product.
